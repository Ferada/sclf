This directory contains an uniforming layer for multiprocessing in the
style supported by Allegro Common Lisp and CMUCL.  Almost nothing of
this has been written by me.  It's mostly the work of Gilbert Baumann
(unk6@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de) and I've shamelessly lifted it from McCLIM.
The copyright disclaimer in this code is compatible with the one of
SCLF, so I believe there should be no legal issues.
